    <h2> A lifestyle blog about living with mental and neurological disabilities </h2>
    <p> The vision for this blog is to provide insights and suggestions for people 
      living with neurological and mental disabilities that help to enhance their quality of life.
    </p>
    <p> The posts, tips, articles, and suggestions are not meant to replace traditional therapy 
      and prescribed medications. However; it is meant to complement both, and aid in increasing
      self sufficiency.

    <p> This is a link to my second blog, <a href="https://myartisdope.wordpress.com" target="_blank">My Art is Dope</a>.
      This is a blog related to the creative content generated from Fifty Shades of Shay. It focuses on 
      showcasing creations in more detail than this blog.
